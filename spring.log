Description:

Field dao in tw.idv.zoe.member.service.impl.MemberServiceImpl required a single bean, but 2 were found:
	- memberDaoImpl: defined in file [C:\SpringBoot_Workspace\ski-member\target\classes\tw\idv\zoe\member\dao\impl\MemberDaoImpl.class]
	- memberRepository: defined in file [C:\SpringBoot_Workspace\ski-member\target\classes\tw\idv\zoe\member\dao\impl\MemberRepository.class]


Action:
